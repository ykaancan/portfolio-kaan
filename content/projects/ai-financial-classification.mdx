## The Challenge

Manual classification of M&A (Mergers & Acquisitions) and corporate news articles was time-consuming and error-prone. Financial analysts needed an automated system that could:

- **Accurately classify** complex financial documents
- **Reduce false positives** that wasted analyst time
- **Process documents quickly** without sacrificing accuracy
- **Handle nuanced content** requiring contextual understanding

The existing manual process took an average of **600 seconds per batch**, and inconsistent classification led to missed opportunities and wasted analyst hours.

## Solution Architecture

I built a **two-stage AI classification system** with verification to balance speed and accuracy.

### Stage 1: Initial Classification
- **Model:** Qwen 2.5 32B quantized (Q4_K_M)
- **Technique:** Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting
- **Purpose:** Perform initial classification with detailed reasoning

### Stage 2: Verification
- **Purpose:** Validate Stage 1 results to reduce false positives
- **Method:** Second pass with focused verification prompt
- **Output:** Final classification with confidence scores

### Infrastructure
- **Framework:** Spring Boot 3.x with Spring AI for LLM integration
- **Inference Server:** vLLM (migrated from Ollama) for production serving
- **Hardware:** On-premise GPU infrastructure with tensor parallelism
- **Model Serving:** vLLM OpenAI-compatible API

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Why Spring AI for LLM Integration?

**Spring AI Benefits:**
- **Unified abstraction** for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Ollama, vLLM)
- **Native Spring Boot integration** with dependency injection and configuration
- **Prompt templates** for consistent LLM interactions
- **Type-safe responses** with structured output parsing
- **Production-ready** with metrics, health checks, and observability

### 2. Why vLLM over Ollama?

**Initial Setup:** Started with Ollama for ease of setup and local development.

**Problem:** Ollama couldn't efficiently utilize on-premise GPU infrastructure for production workloads. Limited parallelism and throughput for our use case.

**Solution:** Migrated to vLLM with tensor parallelism
```bash
# vLLM launch command (pseudocode)
python -m vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server \
  --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct \
  --tensor-parallel-size 4 \
  --gpu-memory-utilization 0.9
```

**Result:**
- Better GPU utilization and throughput on on-premise infrastructure
- OpenAI-compatible API that integrates seamlessly with Spring AI
- Support for larger batch sizes and concurrent requests

### 3. Why Two-Stage Classification?

**Single-stage problems:**
- High false positive rate (35%+)
- No confidence calibration
- Difficult to tune precision/recall trade-off

**Two-stage benefits:**
- **Reduced false positives** by 60%
- **Tunable threshold** between stages
- **Explainable results** via Chain-of-Thought reasoning

### 4. Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Traditional prompting:
```
Classify this article as M&A or not: [article text]
```

Our CoT approach:
```
Analyze this article step by step:
1. Identify key entities (companies, executives)
2. Look for M&A indicators (acquisition, merger, takeover)
3. Assess relevance and significance
4. Provide classification with reasoning
```

This approach improved accuracy by **12 percentage points** compared to direct classification.

## Implementation Details

### Spring AI Integration

```java
// Pseudocode - not actual company code
@Service
public class ClassificationService {

    private final ChatClient chatClient;

    public ClassificationResult classifyDocument(String content) {
        // Stage 1: Initial classification with CoT
        var stage1Prompt = buildCoTPrompt(content);
        var stage1Result = chatClient.call(stage1Prompt);

        if (stage1Result.confidence() < THRESHOLD) {
            return ClassificationResult.notRelevant();
        }

        // Stage 2: Verification
        var stage2Prompt = buildVerificationPrompt(content, stage1Result);
        var stage2Result = chatClient.call(stage2Prompt);

        return combineResults(stage1Result, stage2Result);
    }
}
```

### Performance Optimization

**Challenge:** Initial processing time was still ~200s per batch.

**Optimizations:**
1. **Batch processing** - Group similar-length articles
2. **Connection pooling** - Reuse HTTP connections to vLLM
3. **Async processing** - Non-blocking I/O with Spring WebFlux
4. **Prompt caching** - Cache system prompts in vLLM

**Result:** Average processing time reduced from 600s → 60s

## Results & Impact

### Quantitative Metrics

| Metric | Value | Improvement |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Precision** | 83% | +28% vs. single-stage |
| **Recall** | 78% | +15% vs. manual baseline |
| **Processing Time** | 60s avg | 10x faster than manual |
| **False Positive Rate** | 12% | 60% reduction |
| **Inference Server** | vLLM + Spring AI | Better integration vs. Ollama |

### Qualitative Improvements

- **Consistent classification** across documents
- **Explainable results** via CoT reasoning trails
- **Reduced analyst workload** by filtering out 88% of irrelevant content
- **Scalable infrastructure** ready for additional classification tasks

## Challenges & Learnings

### Challenge 1: Model Selection
**Problem:** Tested 5+ different models (Llama, Mistral, Qwen variants)

**Solution:** Built automated benchmarking framework (see Model Benchmarking project)

**Learning:** Qwen 2.5 32B provided the best balance of accuracy and speed for financial content.

### Challenge 2: Prompt Engineering
**Problem:** Initial prompts produced inconsistent output formats.

**Solution:**
- Structured output schemas
- Few-shot examples in prompts
- JSON mode for parsing

**Learning:** Invest time in prompt engineering - a 10% improvement in prompt quality can yield 20%+ accuracy gains.

### Challenge 3: GPU Memory Management
**Problem:** Occasional OOM errors with long documents (10k+ tokens)

**Solution:**
- Document chunking for long texts
- Dynamic batch sizing based on input length
- Memory monitoring and graceful degradation

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Spring Boot 3.x, Spring AI, Spring WebFlux
